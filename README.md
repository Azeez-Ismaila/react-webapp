# react-webapp
This project is my first attempt at learning github actions.

I wrote a github workflow to deploy this basic react app to github pages which is triggered by commit changes in the master branch.

You can always access the site on - https://azeez-ismaila.github.io/react-webapp/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Build Steps:
* yarn install
* yarn build
